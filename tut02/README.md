## Iterators, Containers & Algorithms

### Assignment?

### Iterator Types
 - Input Iterator
 - Output Iterator
 - Forward Iterator
 - Bidirectional Iterator
 - Random-access Iterator

### Marks.cpp
1. What's wrong with this code?
2. How do we fix it to get the desired behaviour?

### Const vs non-const Iterator?

### Rev.cpp
1. How do we iterate in reverse direction?
2. Why is the cpp way better?

### Iterators.cpp
 - What kind of iterator?
 - Will it compile?

### Overload.cpp
1. Improve the style using overloading
2. Improve it even more using templates

### Map.cpp
Do we understand what is going on here?

### Relationship
What is the relationship between containers, iterators and algorithms?
